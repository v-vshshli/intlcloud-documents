TencentDB data centers are hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are known as regions. Each region contains multiple availability zones (AZs).
Each region is an independent geographic area containing multiple isolated AZs. Separate AZs in the same region are connected via low-latency private networks. Tencent Cloud provides you with the ability to distribute Tencent Cloud resources across different locations. We recommend placing resources in different AZs to eliminate single points of failure which may lead to service unavailability.

Region name and AZ name can most directly embody the coverage of a data center. The following naming convention is used for your convenience:
- A region name is composed of **region + city**. The `region` indicates the geographic area that the data center covers, while the `city` represents the city in or near which the data center is located.
- AZ names utilize the format of **city + number**.

## Regions
Tencent Cloud regions are completely isolated. This guarantees the maximum cross-region stability and fault tolerance. When purchasing Tencent Cloud services, we recommend selecting the region closest to your end users to minimize access latency and improve download speed. Operations such as launching or viewing instances are performed at the region level.
Private network communication:
- Tencent Cloud resources in the same VPC within the same region under the same account can communicate with each other over private network. They can also be accessed via [private IPs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225).
- The networks of different regions are fully isolated from each other, and Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate using private networks by default.
- Tencent Cloud services across regions can communicate with each other through [public IPs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5224) over the Internet, while those in different VPCs can communicate with each other through [CCN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003) that is faster and steadier.
- [Cloud Load Balancer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214) currently supports intra-region traffic forwarding by default. If [cross-region binding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/12014) is enabled, cross-region binding of CLB and CVM instances is supported.

## Availability Zones
Availability zones (AZs) refer to Tencent Cloud's physical data centers that are in the same region. Each AZ is independently powered and have its own network resources. They are designed to ensure that failures within one AZ can be isolated from other zones, thereby ensuring service availability and business stability, excepting the occurrences of large-scale disasters or major power failures. Users can protect their applications from being affected by failures that occur in a single location by selecting instances in independent AZs.
When launching an instance, you can select any AZ in the specified region. For high reliability, you can adopt a cross-AZ deployment solution to ensure that the service remains available when an instance in a single location fails. Examples of such solutions include [CLB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214) and [EIP](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733).
